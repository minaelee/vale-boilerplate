title: Generate your docs site
description: Use Fern Docs to create and host a documentation website and generate API reference documentation from your API definition.
---

With Fern Docs, you can not only automatically [generate an API Reference](/docs/api-references/generate-api-ref) from your API definition, but you can create and deploy your entire documentation hub. The documentation you're reading at this very moment is built with Fern. 

[Write docs pages](/docs/content/write-markdown) just like this one using Markdown or MDX. Then [configure](/docs/config/overview) your docs site's navigation, branding, and more. You can host your site with us, or use a [custom domain](/docs/config/branding/custom-domain).
