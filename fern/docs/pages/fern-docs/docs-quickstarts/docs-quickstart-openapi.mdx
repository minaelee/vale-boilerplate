title: Fern Docs Quickstart with OpenAPI
desc: In this Quickstart, use Fern's starter template with a sample API using OpenAPI to create a documentation website with an auto-generated API reference.
---

Create beautiful documentation in under 5 minutes using an OpenAPI specification (formerly Swagger). Here's [an example](https://docs.propexo.com/documentation).

## Requirements

-   Node 18 or higher
-   A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
-   Familiarity with using a CLI

## Instructions

### Step 1: Create a new GitHub repository from our starter template

1. Log into GitHub and open our [Docs Starter with OpenAPI](https://github.com/fern-api/docs-starter-openapi) GitHub repository.
2. From this repository, click the **Use this template** button.
3. Choose the option to **create a new repository**. Name it `fern-docs`.

### Step 2: Clone and open the repository in your preferred code editor

Clone your newly created repository and open it in your favorite code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The `fern/` folder in your repository contains these files and folders:

<CodeBlock title='fern/'>
```yml
â”œâ”€ docs/
  â”œâ”€ assets/
  â””â”€ pages/
    â”œâ”€ concepts.mdx
    â”œâ”€ sdks.mdx
    â””â”€ welcome.mdx
â””â”€ openapi/
  â””â”€ openapi.yaml
â”œâ”€ docs.yml
â””â”€ fern.config.json
```
</CodeBlock>

The `openapi/` folder contains an `openapi.yaml` file for a sample API called Swagger Petstore. Fern uses this file to generate the API Reference section of your docs site.

The files inside the `pages/` folder are used to generate other documentation pages, such as a Welcome page. The `docs.yml` file sets up site navigation and custom styles. 

### Step 3: Customize organization name and url

In the repository that you cloned locally, open the `fern.config.json` file, which looks like this:

```json
{
  "organization": "Petstore",
  "version": "0.x.x"
}
```

Replace `"Petstore"` with your own organization name within the quotes. Spaces are permitted. Leave the `version` number unchanged.

Open the `docs.yml` file and locate the `url`, which looks like this:

<CodeBlock title='docs.yml'>
```yml
instances:
  - url: petstore-openapi.docs.buildwithfern.com
```
</CodeBlock>

Replace `petstore-openapi` with your own organization's name. Use only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. Do not use spaces, and leave the rest of the URL (`.docs.buildwithfern.com`) unchanged.

<Note>If you intend to set up a custom domain later for your Fern Docs site, set the organization name to match that domain. For instance, if your custom domain is `example.com`, replace `petstore-openapi` with `example` in this step.</Note>

### Step 4: Install the Fern CLI tool

Install the Fern CLI tool globally by running:

```shell
npm install -g fern-api
```

<Callout intent='info'>
The above CLI command is a global command that you can run from any location. The `fern` commands in the following steps must be run from within your repository.
</Callout>

### Step 5: Generate your documentation

Run the following command:

```shell
fern generate --docs
```

When prompted, log into and connect your GitHub account.

Once the documentation is generated, Fern displays the URL where you can view the published documentation. For example:

```shell
â”Œâ”€
â”‚ âœ“  petstore-openapi.docs.buildwithfern.com
â””â”€
```

Instead of `petstore-openapi`, you should see the organization name that you added to `docs.yml` in Step 3.

### Step 6: Customize your documentation

You must run `fern generate --docs` after any modifications to re-generate and publish your documentation site.

To preview updates to your documentation before publishing changes, run `fern generate --docs --preview`.

To modify the API Reference:

- Update the OpenAPI spec in the `openapi/` folder. 

To modify the other docs pages or add new pages:

- Update the files located in the `docs/pages/` folder, such as `welcome.mdx`. See our documentation on [how to write content with Markdown and MDX](/docs/content/write-markdown).

To configure site navigation, styles, and see other configuration options:

- See [Fern Docs Configuration Overview](/docs/config/overview).

To learn about Fern's built-in component library you can use in Markdown:

- See [Components](/docs/components).

### Step 7: Set up a custom domain, subdomain, or subpath

If you wish to use a custom domain (such as `https://example.com`), or a subdomain or subpath on your custom domain (such as `https://docs.example.com` or `https://example.com/docs`), visit the [Custom domain](/docs/config/branding/custom-domain) page.

## About OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)

The OpenAPI specification is a format for describing REST APIs. The specification consists of a single JSON or YAML file. OpenAPI was previously known as Swagger. Fern supports both OpenAPI (3.x) and Swagger (2.x). We refer to the specification as OpenAPI throughout our documentation.
