The `Steps` component is used when you want to display a set of instructions for the user to follow. 

## Usage

Within the `<Steps>` component, preface each step heading with `###` as shown below:

<CodeBlock title="Steps example">
```mdx
<Steps>
  ### Step 1
  Initial instructions.

  ### Step 2
  More instructions.

  ### Step 3
  More instructions.
</Steps>
```
</CodeBlock>

This renders as:

<Steps>
  ### Step 1
  Initial instructions.

  ### Step 2
  More instructions.

  ### Step 3
  More instructions.
</Steps>

You can use your choice of text for each step's heading. For example:

<Steps>
  ### 1: Do something.
  Initial instructions.

  ### Next: Do something else.
  More instructions.

  ### Three.
  More instructions.
</Steps>
