title: Display code snippets using CodeBlocks
description: The CodeBlock component displays a code snippet, with an optional title and language. Use the CodeBlocks component to show multiple snippets in a tabbed view.
---

The `CodeBlocks` component is used when you want to display a code snippet along with a title in a tabbed view.

Within the `CodeBlocks` component, only use [Markdown fenced code blocks](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#fenced-code-blocks) along with optional [syntax highlighting](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/#syntax-highlighting). Please refer to Fern's [Code snippets](/docs/content/code-snippets) guide for a full list of highlighting features.

<Tip>
  If you do not provide a `title` prop for a code block that is inside a `CodeBlocks` component, it will display as
  `Untitled`. In practice, you should always add a `title` to all fenced code blocks when used within `CodeBlocks`.
</Tip>

## Usage

Create a tabbed view containing multiple `CodeBlock` components with the `CodeBlocks` component.

<Note>
  The `CodeBlocks` component does not take any props. For `CodeBlock` components inside a `CodeBlocks` component, be
  sure to set their `title` props to give descriptive titles to the tabs. Otherwise, the tabs by default display
  `Untitled`.
</Note>

Example:

````mdx
<CodeBlocks>
  
```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool for a single project"
npm install fern-api
```

```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool globally"
npm install -g fern-api
```

</CodeBlocks>
````

This renders as:

<CodeBlocks>
  
```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool for a single project"
npm install fern-api
```

```bash title="Install the Fern CLI tool globally"
npm install -g fern-api
```

</CodeBlocks>
