title: Collapse content using Accordion
description: Use the Accordion and AccordionGroup components to show or collapse content from view.
---

The `Accordion` component is used to collapse content until the user chooses to view it. You can group related `Accordion` components together using the `AccordionGroup` component.

## Props

| prop       | type   | description                             | default |
|------------|--------|-----------------------------------------|---------|
| *title*    | string | Displayed title for the Accordion       | none    |

All props are optional. However, generally you should always include a title for an `Accordion`, as otherwise it renders without text like this:

<Accordion>Content for an Accordion with no title</Accordion>

## Usage

### Single Accordion

<CodeBlock>
```mdx
<Accordion title='Single Accordion'>
  Standalone content
</Accordion>
```
</CodeBlock>

This renders as:

<Accordion title='Single Accordion'>Standalone content</Accordion>

### Grouped Accordions

<CodeBlock>
```mdx
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Grouped Accordion 1'>Grouped content 1</Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Grouped Accordion 2'>Grouped content 2</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
```
</CodeBlock>

This renders as:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Grouped Accordion 1'>Grouped content 1</Accordion>
  <Accordion title='Grouped Accordion 2'>Grouped content 2</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
