Fern Bot is a GitHub App that pushes updates to SDKs generated by Fern.

## Installation

1. Visit https://github.com/apps/fern-api and click `Configure`.
1. Select the organization for which you want to install Fern Bot.
1. Select `Only select repositories` and add each of the SDK repositories you want Fern to automatically update.

## Usage in generators.yml

In `generators.yml`, add an entry for the SDK to update in GitHub.

```yaml {7-8} title="Example generators.yml"
default-group: publish
groups:
  publish:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: 0.12.0
        github:
          repository: fern-petstore/petstore-go
```

Running `fern generate` automatically updates the configured repository on GitHub.

By default, the updates are made to the `main` branch. Use the `pull-request` and `push` modes to override this behavior.

### Pull-request mode

Use `mode: pull-request` to make a pull request to the `main` branch instead of committing to it directly.

```yaml {9} title="Example generators.yml"
default-group: publish
groups:
  publish:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: 0.12.0
        github:
          repository: fern-petstore/petstore-go
          mode: pull-request
```

### Push to branch mode

Use `mode: push` to push the generated SDK to a specific branch.

```yaml {9-10} title="Example generators.yml"
default-group: publish
groups:
  publish:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-go-sdk
        version: 0.12.0
        github:
          repository: fern-petstore/petstore-go
          mode: push
          branch: updated-sdk 
```

The above example pushes the generated SDK files to a branch named `updated-sdk`. If the given branch name does not exist, Fern Bot creates it. If no branch name is specified, it uses the `main` branch.
