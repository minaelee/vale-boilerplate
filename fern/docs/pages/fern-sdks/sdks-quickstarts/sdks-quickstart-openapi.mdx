title: SDKs Quickstart with OpenAPI
description: In this Quickstart, install the Fern CLI tool, initialize a Fern project, and generate a sample SDK from an API defined with OpenAPI.

Generate a sample SDK from an OpenAPI specification (formerly Swagger).

In this Quickstart, we'll install Fern, initialize an example API, and generate a TypeScript Node.js SDK.

<Callout intent="tip">
Looking for an alternative to OpenAPI? Give the simpler Fern Definition format a try: [Fern SDKs Quickstart with Fern Definition](/sdks/quickstarts/ferndef).
</Callout>

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Familiarity with using a CLI

## Instructions

### Step 1: Install the Fern CLI tool

In your CLI, run the command:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Step 2: Initialize Fern with your OpenAPI spec

Initialize a Fern project folder with an example configuration and OpenAPI spec:

```bash
fern init --openapi https://petstore3.swagger.io/api/v3/openapi.json
```

This will create a `fern/` folder with the following structure:

<CodeBlock title='fern/'>
```yml
  ├─ fern.config.json # fern project configuration
  ├─ generators.yml # generators to use
  └─ openapi/
    └─ openapi.yml # OpenAPI specification file
```
</CodeBlock>

This folder generally lives in your backend repo, but you can also have an independent repo dedicated to your API (like [Seam's](https://github.com/seamapi/fern-config)).

<Callout intent="info">
You can supply a local path or a remote URL to an OpenAPI spec as the argument of the `--openapi` flag of the `fern init` command. The spec can be formatted in JSON or YAML (`.json`, `yml`, or `yaml`). Fern will copy the OpenAPI spec to the `fern/openapi/` folder, and if it uses JSON, it will be converted to YAML. 
</Callout>

For our example API defined in `openapi.yml`, we use the [Swagger Petstore API](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml), written using the OpenAPI 3.0.2 specification.

This OpenAPI spec defines multiple endpoints, types, and errors. For example, this endpoint places a new order for a pet:
<CodeBlock title="Example endpoint">
```yml
openapi: 3.0.2
paths:
  /store/order:
    post:
      tags:
        - store
      summary: Place an order for a pet
      description: Place a new order in the store
      operationId: placeOrder
      x-swagger-router-controller: OrderController
      responses:
        '200':
          description: successful operation
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                $ref: '#/components/schemas/Order'
        '405':
          description: Invalid input
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Order'
          application/xml:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Order'
          application/x-www-form-urlencoded:
            schema:
              $ref: '#/components/schemas/Order'
```
</CodeBlock>

### Step 3: Generate code

By default, `generators.yml` contains the TypeScript Node.js generator. 

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```diff
default-group: local
groups:
  local:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typscript-node-sdk
        version: 0.x.x
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../generated/sdks/typescript
```
</CodeBlock>

To invoke the generator, run:

```bash
fern generate
```

By default, Fern runs the generator in the cloud, compiles your API definition into files, and downloads them to your computer. Once complete, you'll see new files in `../generated/sdks/typescript/`.

<Callout intent="info">
The `generated/` folder will be created one level up from the `fern/` folder.
</Callout>

## What's next

Congratulations! You installed Fern, initialized a sample API, and generated your first SDK.

To update your API definition, edit the `fern/openapi/openapi.yml` file directly, or replace it with an OpenAPI spec of your own. Run `fern generate` again to generate a new TypeScript SDK.

As a next step, you can:

- Learn more about using an [OpenAPI specification](/overview/define-your-api/openapi/overview)
- Define your API as a [Fern Definition](/overview/define-your-api/ferndef/overview)
- Configure additional [SDK generators](/sdks/overview)
- Publish the Node.js SDK to [npm & GitHub](/sdks/sdk-generators/typescript#publish-a-public-package) _paid feature_

## About OpenAPI (formerly Swagger)

The OpenAPI specification is a format for describing REST APIs. The specification consists of a single JSON or YAML file. OpenAPI was previously known as Swagger. Fern supports both OpenAPI (3.x) and Swagger (2.x). We refer to the specification as OpenAPI throughout our documentation.
