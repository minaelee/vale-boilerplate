Generate a sample SDK from an API defined with the Fern Definition format.

In this Quickstart, we'll install Fern, initialize a sample API, and generate a TypeScript Node.js SDK. 

<Callout intent="tip">
Prefer to use OpenAPI? We've got you covered: [Fern SDKs Quickstart with OpenAPI Specification](/sdks/quickstarts/openapi).
</Callout>

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Familiarity with using a CLI

## Instructions

### Step 1: Install the Fern CLI tool

In your CLI, run the command:

```bash
npm install -g fern-api
```

### Step 2: Initialize Fern with your OpenAPI spec

Initialize a Fern project folder with an example configuration and Fern Definition:
```bash
fern init
```

This will create a `fern/` folder with the following structure:

<CodeBlock title='fern/'>
```yml
  ├─ fern.config.json # fern project configuration
  ├─ generators.yml # generators to use
  └─ definition/ # all Fern Definition files
    ├─ api.yml # general API configuration
    ├─ pet.yml # endpoints, types, and errors for route /pet 
    ├─ store.yml # endpoints, types, and errors for route /store
    └─ user.yml  # endpoints, types, and errors for route /user
```
</CodeBlock>

This folder generally lives in your backend repo, but you can also have an independent repo dedicated to your API (like [Seam's](https://github.com/seamapi/fern-config)).
The example API we use is inspired by the [Swagger Petstore API](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-petstore/blob/master/src/main/resources/openapi.yaml), originally written using the OpenAPI 3.0.2 specification. We have adapted it to demonstrate using the Fern Definition format. 

The Fern Definition files define multiple endpoints, types, and errors. For example, this endpoint places a new order for a pet:
<CodeBlock title="pet.yml">
```yml
service:
  base-path: /store
  auth: false
  endpoints:
    placeOrder:
      display-name: Place order
      docs: Place a new order in the store for a Pet
      method: POST
      path: /order
      request: OrderRequest
      response: Order
      errors:
        - InvalidOrderInputError
      examples:
        - request: $OrderRequest.ExampleOrderRequest
          response: 
            body: $Order.ExampleOrderResponse
```
</CodeBlock>

### Step 3: Generate code

By default, `generators.yml` contains the TypeScript Node.js generator.

<CodeBlock title="generators.yml">
```diff
default-group: local
groups:
  local:
    generators:
      - name: fernapi/fern-typscript-node-sdk
        version: 0.x.x
        output:
          location: local-file-system
          path: ../generated/sdks/typescript
```
</CodeBlock>

To invoke the generator, run:

```bash
fern generate
```

By default, Fern runs the generator in the cloud, compiles your API definition into files, and downloads them to your computer. Once complete, you'll see new files in `../generated/sdks/typescript/`.

<Callout intent="info">
The `generated/` folder will be created one level up from the `fern/` folder.
</Callout>

## What's next

Congratulations! You installed Fern, initialized a sample API, and generated your first SDK.

If you want to update your API definition, edit the files in `fern/definition/` directly, or replace them with other Fern Definition files. Run `fern generate` again to generate a new TypeScript SDK.

As a next step, you can:

- Learn more about using an [OpenAPI specification](/overview/define-your-api/openapi/overview)
- Define your API as a [Fern Definition](/overview/define-your-api/ferndef/overview)
- Configure additional [SDK generators](/sdks/overview)
- Publish the Node.js SDK to [npm & GitHub](/sdks/sdk-generators/typescript#publish-a-public-package) _paid feature_
